/*
 * The following structure describes a window.  Windows are overlapping
 * rectangles.  Each window contains a 'surface', whose contents are maintained
 * by a client of the window package.  The client is responsible for redrawing
 * the surface when requested.  The window package maintains the transform
 * from surface coordinates to screen coordinates and also controls which
 * portion of the surface is currently visable in the window.  See the 
 * comments in windMain.c and above the proc 'WindAddClient' for more info.
 *
 * To see an example of a simple window client, look at the colormap window 
 * located in '~cad/src/magic/cmwind/CMWmain.c'.  A more complex window is
 * the layout window, located in '~cad/src/magic/dbwind/DBWprocs.c'.
 *
 * The following key letters in parens after a field indicate who should 
 * read & write it:
 *
 *	P - Private (window package use only).
 *	R - Read-only (clients should not modify this, but may read it).
 *	W - Writable by client at any time.
 *	C - Writable by the client only during window creation time (in the
 *	    create proc passed to WindAddClient) and readable at all times.
 *	L - Writable by the client at creation time and when the window is
 *	    loaded with a new surface.
 *	G - Private to the graphics module.
 *
 * The comments below often mention a procedure that sets a given field.  This
 * is the normal procedure used to set the field, but there may be other seldom
 * used procs in the window package that set the field.
