/* The main data structure used in the cif module is a description
 * of how to generate CIF layers from the Magic tiles.  There may
 * be several different styles for generating CIF from the same Magic
 * information, e.g. for fabricating at different geometries.  Each
 * of these CIF styles involves three kinds of data.  A "CIFStyle"
 * record gives overall information such as the number of layers.
 * One "CIFLayer" gives overall information for each layer, and
 * then a list of one or more "CIFOp" records describes a sequence
 * of geometrical operations to perform to generate the layer.  This
 * data structure is built up by reading the technology file.
 */

/* A CIFOp starts from a partially-completed CIF layer, does something
 * to it, which may possibly involve some existing layers or temporary
 * layers, and creates the next stage of the partially-completed
 * CIF layer.  Example operations are to AND with some existing paint,
 * or to grow by a certain amount.

 * CIFOP_ANDNOT -	Wherever there is material indicated by the masks,
 *			erase those areas from the current results.
 * CIFOP_OR -		OR current results with the layers indicated by
 *			the masks.
 * CIFOP_GROW -		Grow the current results uniformly by co_distance.
 * CIFOP_SHRINK -	Shrink the current results uniformly by co_distance.
 * CIFOP_BLOAT -	Find layers in paintMask, then bloat selectively
 *			according to co_bloats, and OR the results into
 *			the current plane.
 * CIFOP_SQUARES -	Generates a pattern of squares (used for making
 *			contact vias.  Each square is co_bloats[1] (size) large,
 *			the squares are separated from each other by
 *			co_bloats[2] (separation), and they are inside the edge of
 *			the material by at least co_bloats[0] (border).  If
 *                      co_bloats[3] (align) is nonzero, the squares are aligned
 *                      to the left and bottom tile edges, rather than centered.
 * CIFOP_BLOATMAX -	Like CIFOP_BLOAT, except whole side of tile gets
 *			bloated by same amount, which is max bloat from
 *			anywhere along side.  Bloats can be negative.
 * CIFOP_BLOATMIN -	Same as CIFOP_BLOAT, except use min bloat from
 *			anywhere along side.
