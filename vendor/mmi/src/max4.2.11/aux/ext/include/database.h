 * Description of an array.

 * user:
 *
 * User supplies:
 *	xlo'	index of leftmost array element in root coordinates
 *	xhi'	index of rightmost array element in root coordinates
 *	ylo'	index of bottommost array element in root coordinates
 *	yhi'	index of topmost array element in root coordinates
 *
 * There is no constraint on the order of any of these indices; xlo' may
 * be less than, equal to, or greater than xhi', and similarly for ylo'
 * and yhi'.
 *
 * In addition, the separations xsep and ysep are transformed versions
 * of the separations xsep' and ysep' supplied by the user:
 *
 * User supplies:
 *	xsep'	(positive) X spacing between array elements in root coords
 *	ysep'	(positive) Y spacing between array elements in root coords
 *
 * When the array is made via DBMakeArray, both the indices and the spacings
 * are transformed down to the coordinates of the CellDef that is the child
 * of the use containing the ArrayInfo.
 *
 * The significance of the various values is as follows:  the [xlo, ylo]	
 * element of the array is gotten by transforming the celldef by the
 * transformation in the celluse.  the [x, y] element is gotten by
 * transforming the celldef by xsep*abs(x-xlo) in x, ysep*abs(y-ylo) in
